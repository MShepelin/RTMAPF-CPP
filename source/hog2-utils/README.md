In this project we use MAPF benchmarks from [MovingAI](https://movingai.com/benchmarks/mapf.html). To read files with map data we use utils from HOG2 as it was mentioned in the source. 

> HOG2 (Hierarchical Open Graph 2) is a collection of classes and a tile-based simulator which are designed as a simple model of RTS and other clocked simulation environments.

Files *ScenarioLoader.cpp* and *ScenarioLoader.h* are direct copies from the [HOG2 GitHub repository](https://github.com/nathansttt/hog2).
